# API & UI Testing Demo (Pytest + Playwright + Allure Reporting + GitHub Actions CI)

This project demonstrates professional test automation for APIs using **Python**, **Pytest**, and **Allure Reporting**, with a fully automated **CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions**. It also integrates **Pydantic** for API schema validation and publishes clean, visual test reports via **GitHub Pages**.

---

## Notes for Hiring Managers

- Demonstrates advanced QA automation capabilities with API and reporting integrations.
- Shows real-world CI/CD pipeline configuration with automated test execution and reporting.
- Highlights structured, maintainable test code using best practices and modern tools.

## For running tests locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install
pytest --alluredir=allure-results
allure serve allure-results  # Requires Allure CLI installed
```

## Planned Enhancements

- Introduce **UI Automation Testing** with Selenium or Playwright.
- Integrate UI tests into the same CI pipeline with unified Allure reporting.
- Add API schema validation using `jsonschema` for broader tool exposure.
- Explore test data management and parameterization for more scalable testing.
